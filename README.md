# Library Content Management System

The Library Content Management System is a web-based application that aims to improve the functionality, responsiveness, and user-friendliness of the library's blog. It provides an owned space for the library to easily update news, manage book availability, and enhance user experience.

## Project Overview

The project focuses on creating a more effective and visually comfortable theme for the library's blog. It aims to improve the viewer and admin sides, making them more interactive and responsive. The key objectives of the project include:

- Enhancing the responsiveness and user-friendliness of the blog.
- Integrating book availability information into the blog.
- Improving the effectiveness of the existing Question Bank feature.
- Implementing a content management system that allows easy updating of news and other details.
- Providing an efficient and visually appealing theme for viewers and admins.

## Methodology

The project follows the AGILE methodology, which promotes continuous iteration of development and testing throughout the software development lifecycle. The core values of the AGILE methodology include:

- Prioritizing individual and team interactions over processes and tools.
- Focusing on working software rather than comprehensive documentation.
- Emphasizing customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change rather than following a rigid plan.

The project progresses through the following phases:

1. Requirements Gathering: Define the project requirements, evaluate technical and economic feasibility, and collaborate with stakeholders to understand business opportunities.

2. Design: Create user flow diagrams and high-level UML diagrams to design the requirements and visualize how new features will integrate with the existing system.

3. Construction/Iteration: Develop and deploy a working product with minimal functionality. Continuously improve the product through iterations.

4. Testing: Conduct comprehensive testing to ensure the product's performance and identify and fix any bugs.

5. Deployment: Release the product to the user's working environment.

6. Feedback: Gather user feedback and incorporate it to further enhance the product.
